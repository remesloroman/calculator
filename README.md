# Qualqulator

## Description

**Qualqulator** is a modern calculator with a clean, customizable UI built from custom elements.  
It uses a [Pratt parsing algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-precedence_parser#Pratt_parsing) for expression evaluation, ensuring correct operator precedence and making the system easily **extensible**.  
The combination of a **modular UI** and robust parsing highlights both usability and solid software design.

## Dependencies
